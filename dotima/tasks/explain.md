# your task
  - output a SUMMARY of the INPUT
  - then output the INPUT, without altering it in any way, including whitespace
  - the SUMMARY should
    - mark the begining with <AI>
    - mark the ending with </AI>
    - use comment marks where appropriate as per the conventions of the INPUT

# for example, given the following ruby program as INPUT:

```ruby
file = ARGV.shift

buf = IO.binread(file)

puts buf.reverse
```

# your output should be similar to:

```ruby
# <AI>
# this is a ruby program that
# - accepts a single file as an argument
# - reads the file
# - prints it in reverse
# </AI>
file = ARGV.shift

buf = IO.binread(file)

puts buf.reverse
```
