# your task
  - scan the INPUT
  - generate a SUMMARY of the INPUT
  - output first the SUMMARY, then the INPUT
  - you MUST NOT alter the INPUT in any way
  - when outputting the SUMMARY you should
    - mark the begining of it with <AI>
    - mark the ending of it with </AI>
    - comment the entire summary out using the conventions of the INPUT

# for example, given the following ruby program as INPUT:

```ruby
file = ARGV.shift

buf = IO.binread(file)

puts buf.reverse
```

# your output should be similar to:

```ruby
# <AI>
# this is a ruby program that
# - accepts a single file as an argument
# - reads the file
# - prints it in reverse
# </AI>
file = ARGV.shift

buf = IO.binread(file)

puts buf.reverse
```
